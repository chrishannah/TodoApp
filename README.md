This is a basic todo app built with Realm as the local database.

## Features

You can add, edit, and delete tasks, and also toggle them as being completed.

**Search**

The search facility allows you to search through tasks based upon the task name.

**Sort**

You can sort the tasks based on the Task name, priority, and the completion status. All of these are available in ascending and descending order.

**Filter**

You can also filter these tasks even further by their priority, and also their completion status.
